sorry for delayed respond, but it was a really hard desicion for me, so I thought I could think properly before giving any asnwer. 
The good news is that meanwhile i was searching for income, After Greek tragedy,I managed to get job offer by Apple to work on Next Generation of Apple watchs. 
The bad news is that due to immigration laws, as Perminant Resident of Canada, until I obtain a Canadian Passport, it very challenging to obaitan US work permit. and the ligal group in Apple was busy, so that they would be able to work on my file next year.
Hence I was really rewarded and motivated to complete the work that I had done thus far, as a bright future is mostlikely reality given my expereince in Biomedical System Design. 

Meanwhile, I managed to find an other job in Vancouver with 70K to support myself finanflically after the Greek Tragedy. That enables me to work and study at the same time. 

The challenge is how to be present in Victoria and Vancouver at the same time. 

Given the situation I woudl like to consult with you, and ask if it is possible to not receive the TA support as you have kidnely offered, and work along the way as I study. and meet with you regularly on this topic.
